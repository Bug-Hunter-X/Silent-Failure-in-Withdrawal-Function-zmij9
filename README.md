# Silent Failure in Solidity Withdrawal Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Solidity smart contracts: silent failures in value transfers.  The `withdraw` function, while seemingly robust, can fail without providing any indication to the caller if the recipient's contract reverts.

The problem is addressed in `bugSolution.sol`.

## Vulnerable Code (`bug.sol`)

The `withdraw` function uses `call{value: amount}`.  While the `success` variable is checked, this only catches low-level errors like out-of-gas situations.  If the recipient contract's fallback function throws a revert exception, `success` will still be true.

## Solution (`bugSolution.sol`)

The improved function utilizes the `send` function, which has different semantics than `call`.  The solution checks the return value of `send` for failure, providing a more robust mechanism against silent failures.  If you need more gas than `send` allows, then you can use the `call` function and check the return data for revert exceptions using assembly.
